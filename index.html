            Anthony Edward Stark, also known as Tony Stark, was born to two S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Amanda Armstrong and Jude.
            Jude was a secret Hydra double-agent with little regard for anybody but himself and regularly sold-out fellow S.H.I.E.L.D.
            operatives. He was almost responsible for Amanda's own death at the hands of an assassin. However, he fell in love with Amanda
            before sending her to her death and decided to save her.[38] After this incident they got to know each other and began a relationship
            .[39] Two years later, Amanda became pregnant. A week before giving birth to the baby, Jude decided to reveal his true allegiance to
            Amanda and its implications in Jude's timely intervention that saved her life. The subsequent discussion escalated, and Amanda killed Jude.
        Traumatized by this development, Amanda asked S.H.I.E.L.D. to ensure her future baby would find a safe and happy home. However, 
        director Nick Fury followed the same procedure used for unwanted pregnancies in the agency, and the baby was left in an orphanage in Sofia,
        Bulgaria after Amanda birthed him in a local hospital. Fury's associate and famous industrialist Howard Stark learned of this and decided to find
        the baby and adopt him, keeping the name Amanda wished he retained: Anthony.</p>
